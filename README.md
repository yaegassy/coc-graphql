> fork from a [graphql/vscode-graphql](https://github.com/graphql/vscode-graphql)

GraphQL extension for [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim)

## !! Note & Warning !!

I don't use "GraphQL" regularly, so if you like "GraphQL", please refer or copy to this repository and create coc-graphql by yourself.

## Install

**vim-plug**:

```vim
Plug 'yaegassy/coc-graphql', {'do': 'yarn install --frozen-lockfile'}
```

## Prepare

Create GraphQL configuration in your project: `.graphqlrc` or `.graphqlrc.{json,yaml,yml,js,ts,toml}` or `graphql.config.{json,yaml,yml,js,ts,toml}`.

## Configuration options

Check the "contributes.configuration" section of `package.json`.
